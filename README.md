# EXP4
AIM:
To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.

SOFTWARE USED:
VS Code

THEORY:
Bitwise operators in C++ are used to perform operations directly on the binary representation of integers. They provide efficient ways to manipulate data at the bit level, which is especially useful in tasks like flag operations, low-level system programming, and memory optimization.
The common bitwise operators include:
- AND (&): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 only where both operands have 1.
- OR (|): Returns a result with bits set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in either operand is 1.
- XOR (^): Produces a result where bits are set to 1 only when the corresponding bits in the operands are different.
- NOT (~): Inverts all the bits of the operand, flipping 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.
- Left Shift (<<): Shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions, essentially multiplying the number.
- Right Shift (>>): Shifts all bits to the right, which is equivalent to integer division by powers of two.

CONCLUSION:
Bitwise operators are powerful tools that allow programmers to work directly with the binary form of numbers. While they might seem technical at first glance, mastering them unlocks deeper control over data, especially in performance-critical applications. By studying and implementing bitwise operations, you gain a valuable skill set for tackling more advanced C++ concepts like masking, flag handling, and embedded system coding.
